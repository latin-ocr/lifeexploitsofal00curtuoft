“1·8(111888.” Time, however, has exploded all these theories and
established the one first mentioned.

Ipsi, sc. Dario.

Purpuracis.—“ Courtiers,” i. e. Those clothed in garments of that
hue which for ages has been appropriated to sovereigns and their
favourites.

Satisne ei, cftc.—“ Whether he seemed well enough provided to
annihilate the enemy? '’ obterendum is a very strong word. It
signifies, “ to grind to pieces‚’' “ to erush,” “ to waste away by con-
tinual rubbing.''

Verum, inquit, «fic. Verum : “ The truth.’' The aversion of tyrants
to listen to the truth is well satirized in the following lines of Juve-
nal, referring to Domitian: .

——Quid violentius aure tyranni,
Cum quo de pluviis, aut cestibus aut nimboso
Vere locumrisatum pendebat amici ,2
Sar. iv. 85.

Quantum, ‹fia—‘⁶ To such a degree, that those, who have not
118811 eye-witnesses of it, can form no idea of it in their minds.”

Torva—inculta.—“ Terrible '' 111 their aspect‚—“ uneouth'’ in their
habiliments.

has often been suecessfully employed, both in ancient and modern
times.

conserta robora—This expression savours more of Curtius, the
rhetorician‚ than of Charidemus, the rough warrior. And here it is
well to put the student in mind that the speeches, so often occur-
ring in this work, are wholly imaginative on the part of the author,
or at most, have but a slight foundation in fact. Other historians,
both ancient and modern, have put specches into the mouths of
those introduced by them to the 888118 of action. Raderus justly
says, “ that in 1118 eloquent character os his speeches, no 0118 18 equal
to Curtius, certainly no one 18 superior.”

Plaealanyem—This mode of arranging infantry in 81088 11188,
marching in lock step, and uniting their shields together, 80 as to
opposc an almost impenetrablc mass to the 011881 os the enemy, was
peculiar to the Macedonians. The phalanx generally bore the brunt
os the action.

Ad nutum monentia—This indicates a very high state of military
discipline, equalled only by the manomvrcs os modern soldiers, con-
ducted by the lap 011118 (irum.
