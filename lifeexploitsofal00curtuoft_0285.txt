16. Manio-atas lanima—Tum& with long sleeves, which, by the
ancient Romans, were considered very effeminate. Those who
came into the presence of the Persian monarch, were required to
cover their hands with long sleevae, as a preeaution against assas-
sination.

17. Doryphori.-An appellation derived from the long spear borne
by them ;—from their sometimes having a goldeu apple placed on
the point of their spear, they were also called Aseloplwri.

18. simulacra cubitalia—As these images were at least eighteen inehes
high, it has been supposed that they were hollow and of a light
construction, to avoid overburdening the necks of the horsoe.

19. Pinnae—whence pinibus, the wing seathers‚ as distinguished

from pennas, the feathers of the body. The distinction, however,
‹10ae not always hold good.

20. Purpureae, ‹ea-That is: the general eolour of the gai-ment was
purple, but the middle was relieved by a stripe of white.

21. E: qemmd.—That is: “ of several gems.” In like manner we say
“ of pearl,” meaning “ of several pearlsss’

22. Cydarim—This headdraes was not peeuliar to the king, except
in the form of the apex, which, in his, rose to a conieal point; in
that of others, inclined towards the front.

23. Armanaxaa—“Littersf or “ covered ehariots.”

24. Lizanem d calonum—‘³ Sutlers and baggage slavaess’

25 Noc turbe—The best interpretem apply this to the soldiers alone,
and not to the camp followers: and this view of it seems to be jus-
tified by what is said below. Ergo Alexandro, ‹ea—Our author is
evidently contrasting the compact, well-armed, well-disciplined,
though small body of the Macedoniam, with the glittering, but

confused and ill-disciplined multitude that followed the standard of
Darius.

LIB. ΠΙ. CAP. IV.

1. Caetra Cyri-See Note 4, Lib. iv. Cap. vii.
2. stativa, sc. Castra. In the same way Hiberna, AEstiva, dte„ are
used absolutely.

3. Munimenea, governed by imitante. May not Curtius have written
imitantes, referring to fauces? and then naturali citu would be the
ablative of manner.

5. Fuit in the sense of suia-vet.
