the king repeated aster him.

15. Demittere—acz'm—“ To charge down.’'

16. Agitabat.—“ He was resolving.''
17. An potitis, dha—“Whether he should not rather hurl down 'his

18. Action—“More profound” than it would have been, had it not

20. Potens mei non eram—“I was not myself.” I had no control

21. Raro* admodum, cisa—“Very rarely, and then rather at the en-
treaty of his friends than from sear of any danger that was to be
eneountered, was he aceustomed to make use of defensive armour;
at that time, indeed, he put it on and went forth to the soldiers.”
Quoque seems to be used here, as is frequently the case in this
author, for quidem,· or it may indicate that now “also ” he was
acting on the advice of friends. Understand eo with sumpto.

22. Amyntas princeps erat—Amyntas was now absent in Macedonia,
as we find from Lib. iv. ἓ 26, ad fin. .· eonsequently mention is here
made of him simply as the commander of this division, not as lead-

Amyntas.

24. In societatem nuper adscitus.—“ Lately called to this oonnexion'

from being satisfied with it. Freinsheim proposes Phryyae Balacnu
rqqebat, in soc. nup. adscitos ; though he at the same time observes:
“Omnia haec sunt obscurissimw Perhaps the true reading is:
Filius Balacrus reyebat eos, in soc. nup. adscitus ‚· for we find from
Arrian, (Lib. iii. p. 155, Blnnc. ed. 1668) that Amyntas had a son
Balacrus, and who more likely 1111111 ho, if in other respects quali-
fied,'to command his father-'s division during his tempor-ary ab·

senec?
25. Ultimum agmen, ‹ba—“Ile hnd protected his reni· by a strong

“that he might protect his nrmy from every quarter.'‘
