Note

1. Statuit ipsc daeccr7zcre.—“ Resolved to decide the contest in per-
son.'’

2. Circumdato, ‹sta—What a gloomy picture of the buechery of war
does this passage present, where men are represented as pennaed up,
as sheep for the slaughter.

3. Quam pro numera—“Thau in proportion to their actual number.'’

4. Eques—A use of the singular for the plural, common in descrlbing
different kinds of troops. We find, in like manner, mile-³ used to
denote the whole body of the soldiery.

5. Oeam—A small leathern buckler, used by some tribes in Spain,
and supposed by· the best authors to' be of a rhomboidal shape.

6. E9re9ii, ut inter illae yentea—“ Distinguished warriors when mea-

or ‘⁴ Arabian Gulf.” The audente, however, applied the term to the
whole extent of ocean washing the southern coasts of Asia. As to
the origin of the appellation, learned men are now agreed that it
was derived from a cert-ain king Erythras or Erythrus (see Lib.

viii. cap. ix. ξ 29), whom they suppose to have been no other than
Esau the son of Isaac. From his selling his birthright for a mess of
red pottage, he received the name of Εᾰοηι, “ Red ”3 and as his de-
scendants were called Edomites, and settled on the borders of this
sea, it was naturally called the Sea of Edom or the ‘¹ Red Sea,”—the
Greeks translating Edom by ‘⁸ Erythraeum‚” the Latius by “ Ru-

writers that it derived its name from the colom· of its waters, though
they differed widely as to the cause of the “ redness.” The wash os
the adjacent soiL—-the reflection of the sun's rays from the neighbour-

this shallow sea,—have each been advocated as the source of tha
