In paucis Alexandro carua—“ Especially dear to Alexander.‘’ The
phrase in paucis seems rather a favourite one with this author, and
in this place appears to convey the idea that, amony theseus who were
deur to Alexander, Hector was one.

Hector, diu, ‹fia—‘⁸ Hector having struggled long with the current,
while his drenched gat-ments and sandals bound to his feet prevent·

14. &madantum—This verb is followed by the dative, when ap·
