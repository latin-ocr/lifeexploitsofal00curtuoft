to various conjectural readinlgs ;-that of the text is the common one
and is thus explained by Zumpt: “Followiny tlte foot of the wall ;
that is: 902’229 along] the bottom os it.'' Of this reading, Schmieder says,
Quod Latinum esse dubito : vestigia extant, muro proeter fundamenta
deleto. Heinsius proposes fastiyia instead of vesti-qia, which cer-
tainly connects better with deturbatis propuynatorz'buS, as their
station would be along the top of the wall. Perhaps the following
may be the true reading, det. pro. muri, vestiyia persequens Reyz's,
supervenit. That is: Though Peucestes mounted the wall at a dif-
ferent part of the city, yet he traced tlte course tlte king] had taken and
came up to his assistance. At all events the objection to this read-
ing (namely, that persequens vestiyia necessarily denotes an actual
following in the footsteps of another) is no more insuper-able than
that against the reading in the texss.
