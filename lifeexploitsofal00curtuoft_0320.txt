19. Simpliciter.—“ Candidly.'’

LIB. IV. OAP. ΧΠ,

1. Graviore comitatu refers to the prisonem, the siek and wounded,
and, perhaps to some of the keavier bayywe, though that is doubtful,
as the word impedimenta just below would include it.

2. Conciti-³ equis—Zumpt reads cum citis equitibus. There are other
various readinys. We suggest cum certis equitibus.

3. Mille admodum—“ A thousand in all.”

4. Αφηεη ejus claudebant.—-“Formed (lit. “ closed '’) the rear of his
eolumn.⁷'

5. Pedites his plurium, ὢσ.-“ To these each [commender] had an-
nexed the infantry of several nations, not mingled indiscriminately,
but each the forces of his own nation.'' We are not entirely satis-
fied with the reading of the text, and yet, perhaps, it is the best
that has been suggested. Freinsheim proposes to consider pedites
in the nominative, and gives this reading and order. “Pedites
plurium yentium his (praedietis) junxerant copias, non mixtus, eea
quisque suoe nationis, seilicet, copias.”

6. Rubri Maria—See Note 8‚.Lib. iii. Cap. ii.

in 1·eality.”

the origin of the word “panio '' will find it in Polyaenus, or, if more
convenient, in the extracts from that author in Groeca Majora,
(Vol. 1., p. 329.)

11. Flammasque, ‹fia—The order is: Velutque illati (se. Macedones)
temere (unwittingly) proesidz't's credebant flammas splendere ex castris
Darii.
