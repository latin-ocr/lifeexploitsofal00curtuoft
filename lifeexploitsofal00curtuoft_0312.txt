cities and province in a friendly manner,'' while the latter was still
on the Pelusiae branch. Zumpt, following the suggestion of Schmie·
der, reads Heroon amne superato, and refers to the canal “ from the
Pelusian branch of the Nile, past the city of Heroes, to the Red
Sea? ¹But the words eodem flumine, in the next sentence, in our
view, overthrow this conjecture, for how could Alexander pass “ from
Memphis into the interior of Egypt,” north or south, by the river
of Heroes. Ortelius suggests ocyus amne and hocce amne, but neither
appears satisfactory. The common reading Onio or Orio is palpably
corrupt. To the multitude of conjectures, we would add odio omni
superato, ‘⁶ suppressing (overcoming) every feeling of hostility,’' not
as the undoubted reading, but as, perhaps, suggestive of it to some
future annotator. Odio, in the sense of “hostility,” is found at the
close of the 3d chap. of the eth Book.

‚Ad interiora qupti.—Zumpt very decidedly applies these words
to the “ western parts of Lowcr Egypt.’' We think the word pene-
trat will hardly justify such a version. The brevity of Curtius in
this place is the only argument against the more natural interpreta-
tion, viz.: ΤῙιΘ regions of southern or Upper Egypt. The course of
Alexander, as appears to us from a comparison of the narrat-ivos
of Curtius and Arrian, was this: Having reached the Pelusiae mouth
of the Nile in seven days after leaving Gaza, hc marchcd thence on
the right bank of the Pelusiae branch to Heliopolis, situate a little
above the apex of the Delta. On this march he received the sub-
mission of Mazaces. Still keeping on the right bank till he arrived
opposite to Memphis (which is on the left, fifteen miles above the
apex), he there crossed and spent some days in that city, where
he sacrificed to Apis and other dcities, and instituted games. Thence
he made an excursion up the river ad interiora Eyypti, of which
the particulars arc not given, and then, rcturning to Memphis,
arranged his affairs preparatory to setting out sor the oraclo of
Hammon. When all was ready, he movcd down the river and
through the Canopic branch till he reached the sca, where hc found·
ed Alexandria. Thence, marching along tho coast, he arrived at
I'croetonium, from which place he plunged, by a direct southern
course, into the dcscrts that surroundod the temple of Hammon.
