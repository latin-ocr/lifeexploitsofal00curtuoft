Note
Nam ubi illo ad vera,- quasi patriciis pueri-2 aut monedula»
Aut anates, aut coturnices dantur, quicum lusitent,·
Itidem hoec mihi advenienti upupa, qud mihi delectem, data est.

37. Corpusque.—Aeidalius acutely suggests, corpus usque.

LIB. 1V. CAP. IV.

1. Hi0.—“ At this juncture.''

a. soluta obsidione, ά·ε.-“ To raise the siege and direct his march to
Egypt?

3. Irritum.—“ Foiled of his purpose.''

4. Bellum—An American will hardly read this description with-
out calling to mind the sea serpent so famous in the neighbourhood
of Boston.

5. Emonia—If the remark of the Delphin editor on the word abripu-
isse, a little below, be well founded, namely, Neptunum sic molem in
praeceps daturum, quomodo cetam repente mersisset, then we think the
reading here should be demersit, “he plunged into the deep,'' signify·
ing to the Tyrians, that thus would the mole, appearing to them
like some huge animal, sink into the waters.

6. Dilapsi.—This word, lit-crally signifying “ gliding in different
directions‚'' admirably represents the well satisfied manner in which
a number of persons, who have been overwhelmed in doubts and
scars, mutually separate when relieved from those doubts and sears.

7. Prima e Macedonum, ct·c.-—“ The first os the Macedonian vessels
that came up was a quinquereme, distinguished above thc rest for
its speed.''

8. Etlevam—‘¹ From opposite directions.” The idea eonveyed by
the whole context is this: When the quinquereme found herself
attaeked on both sides, she turned suddenly around upon one of her

:³

adversaries, but, before she could get far enough around to bring her
own beak to bear upon the side of her antugonist, nnd while in the
act of turning, she exposed her side to the beak of her opponent,
which was forced iu so far as to unite the two vessels together.

9. Excuteretur e puppi.—Any onc who hns seen the representatione
of ancient vessels ean easily understand, how much the pilots were
exposed to accidente, like the one here mentioned. Thc unhnppy
sate os Palinurus (AEncid v. 857) must occur to the render.
