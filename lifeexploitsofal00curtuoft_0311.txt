Gaza—According to Josephus, Alexander made an excursion to
Jerusalem previous to setting out sor Egypt. This expedition is
graphieally described by the Jewish historiari, and the reason of its
omission by Curtius and other profane writers is well discussed by
Williams. (Life of Alexander, p. 127, Harpers’ ed.)

Castra Alexandri.—We have already met with Castra Cyri, and
the recurrence herc of a similar phrase, denoting a town or settle-
ment on the site of an ancient camp, leads us to remark that the
student will find numerous instancoe of this nature in England. The
ancient eamps‚ particularly those of the Romans, were laid out and
fortified with such care and strength, that, even when their military
occupants had deserted them, the very remains presented con-
veniences and advantages so superior to those possessed by the rude
and barbarous people among whom they were pitched, that they
were resorted to by numbers as their best and most secure place of
abode. In some cases, asin those which have occasioned this note,
the term ‘¹ camp,” with the name of the hero who pitched it, would
adhere vo the place. In other cases it would receive an entirely
new name from its new occupants. In England a middle course
seems generally to have been followed, as there we find the word
Castra corrupted into caster, Gesner, chester, ἀτη and united with
the names of those who first took advantage of the departure of their
Roman conquerors, as, Lamaster, Circae-ester, Colclmtersdx.

[Οείὶο amnis superato.]—We have enclosed these words in brack-
ets from a conviction that the text is altogether corrupt, and that
no emendation, hitherto suggested, ls wholly free from insuperable
objections. The reading in the text, though the best we have met
with, is hardly sanctioned by the context, which represents Mazaces
as making the surrender in the neighbourhood of Memphis, which
was far removed from any mouth of the Nile. We may, it is true,
overcome this objection by supposing the whole Pelusiae braneh
(extending from fisteeu miles below Memphis to the sea), as intended
by ostio. In this case Mazaces might very well pass down the lest
bank of the river and cross the Pelusiae braneh at the place where
Alexander then was. In this way it agrees with the statement of
Arrian (Lib. iii. init.),—that Mazaces “received Alexander into his
