Ί. Lacrunmdorum-“ Petty robbers.” A diminutive from latro,

8. Furtum melia—“A nocturnal stratagem.” Alexander, in this
speech, implies that the glory of his victor-ies at the Granicus and
at Issus had been lessened—in the former case, by the absence of
Darius; in the latter, by the circumstances of the place, which,
while favourable to himself, were adverse to the enemy. Now,
however, he was determined to contend, in all respects, on equal
terms, except in regard to numbers, wherein Darius would have
the advantage.

9. Solem mtrem—“Mithra or Mera, a deity of Persia, generally

about like madmen.”

13. Ipsum ducem, sc. Alexandrum.
