ΝΟ versed in history is, that private revenge was the sole cause of

Philip’s death. Doubtless it was matter of rejoieing to the Persium,
who were well aware of his daeigns upon their country. Alexander,
however, is not the only conqueror, that has made use of unfounded
assertions to justify his rapacity.

13. ,Εἰοὶἰαπιὶηὶ-έ( Yon put up at auction.” “ Yon expose to salef
¹‘ Yon set a price upon.'' That is: “ Yon offer the highest rewards
sor the heads of your enemies.’‘ A dastardly course, and yet osten
thought justifiable in the case of rebels. Thus a price was set on
the head of Washington, and, recently, on that or Kossuth, the Hun-
garian pati-iot.

14. Proxime.—“ Very lately.''

15. Utpote qui, ὡσ,-“ Inasmueh ns thou art one who hast not,” &e-

16. Comulere viem—“To take measurae sor the benefit of the van-
quished.”

17. Memento, aea—This answer truly savours of the moral sublime,
aepeeially when it is considered that Alexander was in the midst. of
the enemy's country with a comparatively small army.

18. Ipse, sc. Alexander.

19. sidem—A Greek acc. sing.

20. Doris· opibus adjutus, «ea—Freinsheim suggests addicta-³, et quia,
and the suggestion is favoured by many subsequent editors. It
certainly gives a better sense than the reading in the text. Perhaps
some words may have fallen out, and the whole passage may have
conveyed this meaning; “ Strato was reigning in that city, support·
ed by the resourcee of Darius. He nevertlaeleu betrayed Ιιίε mut and
surrendered αισι-ἰᾷ] ,· but because,” dte. The words deditionem fecerat
certainly imply a previous mention of the fact.

21. Eo svavia—‘⁶ That elevationl'

22. Hospita—Hospes may denote “ the entertainer” or “ the one en-
tertained;”—“ the host” or “the guest! Here it signifiee those
with whom Hephaestion “ took up his quartem?

23. Neyaveruntplt is osten well, in translating, to transfer the nega-
tive, contained in this word, to the following verb, as in this in-
stance, ‘⁸ Who declared that no one,’' &e- Again, Neyavit ee vcn-
turum eae, “ He declared that he would not come.”

24. Mada—Some dei-ive this word from ’παρὰ aucei, others {rom an
obsoleto verb maqo, whence aleo maqnm, moyis, dte. Macci virtute
seems, in every instance, to be the expression of a wish on the part
of the speaker, sor a vix-tuone and honourable prosperity in behalt of
those addressed.
