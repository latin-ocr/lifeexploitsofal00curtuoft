nores. 309

Note

23. emmoni-“To torturess'

24. Cast& sancteque—This clause depende upon Testes, which is here
equivalent to ad testzflcandum. Habitum, “Treatedss’

25. Si de me, ‹fta—‘⁸ If already my sate is determined.”

LIB. IV. CAP. XL

1. Expressit—“Have constrained.” The singular verb understood
with the first noun, and expressed with the other. This is often
the case, where the nouns have a cognate signification.

2. Pro tribus corporibus—‘⁸ For their three personsl'

3. Ibi-qima millia talentum aurat—This amount of gold is beyond all
belief ; and, as Diodorus states the sum at 3,000 talents, triyinta
appears to us to be a corrupt reading. Zumpt adheres to the
numbers here given, but supposes they refer to talents of silver
paid in gold eoin. Asto value of talent, see Note 16, Lib. iii. Cap. i.
The amount in our curreney of 30,000 talenta of gold would be
8316,65o,ooo.

4. Notum haberem—Equivalent to noverim. We find also habeo
compertum, and some other instanees where the use of habeo is
similar to that of our auxiliary verb “to hsve.”

6. Dzfficile est continere, dra—‘⁸ It is difficult to retain what you ean-
not grasp.”

¹¹1. Nescio, an Darius, dxx—‘⁴ 1 do not know but that Darius,” dte.

8. Mnus jam, ‹fia—‘⁴ That you have now less room for the display
os your compassion than you had.’'

9. Nunc, memma—“N ow, ss Alexander.”

10. Securus denotes, not sasety itself, but only the feeling os security.

11. Veram mian vero'.—-“ But now truly.”

12. Modo—modd.—“ At one time—at another?

13. Post Euphratem—Thu is: To the west of the Euphrates.

14. Rhoetum—Used ironically.

15. Ubi ἐρίων, ώο.-“Ψ1ιει·ε, 1 pmy you, are you addressing me ”l
Iyitur seems here to bear a sense similar to that of tandem in nsking
questions os this nature.

10. Nempe quam, ‹ssa—‘⁸ One, forsooth, who would otherwise marry,''
.7.&QMuleum 2·er‹3.-‘·Truly he does me much honour in preferring,”
dxc.
