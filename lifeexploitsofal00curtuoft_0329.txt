16. Statuit—The statement contained in this sentence, in Zumpt‘a
opinion “ stands-in some measure in contradiction to what was said
above; namely‚ that Alexander’s return was called forth only by
Parmenio’s message. Here he forms the resolution spontaneously.”
N ow we perceive no such contradiction, nor, we think, will a correct
understanding of the context justisy such a conclusion. Our author
states that the king proceeded a considerable distance (multum vioe)
in the pursuit‚ when messengers from Parmenio arrived informing
him, that that general was hard pressed on the left wing. Alexan-
der, though sorely vexed (frendente) at being compelled to relin-
quish the pursuit, nevertheless did s0, and, as we suppose, just be-
yond the Lycus and in full view of the fugitives. After mentioniug
this halt, our author goes back to the events meanwhile (interim)
transpiring on the left wing, relates the effect of Darius' flight on
Mazaeus, the defeat of the latter by means of the Thessaliam cavalry,
and his final retreat to Babylon. He then states that Darius had
hastened (contenderat) over the Lycus and reached Arbela by mid-
night. The mention of Darius having carried him a little forward
in the order of time, he returns again to take notice of the sad con-
dition of the fugitives, and refers to what had been already men-
tioned (uc cupra dictum est), namely, that Alexander, upon hearing
of Parmenio's difficulties, had checked the pursuit (inhibito cuna) ;
with the additional circumstance that he had arrived (pervenerat) at
the Lycus on his way back to assist Parmenio. As soon as the
aoldiers perceived his intention to give up the pursuit, they urged
upon him not tolet the fugitives escape with impunity. To this he
gives the reply, hebetia cela, ὥσ. ,· true as far as it went, but not the
whole truth, for the evil tidings from Parmenio he could not, as a
wise general communicate to them. Our author then goes on to
state, in the passage before us, that the real reason of his resolution
to return was his anxiety about the lest wing, and this anxiety he
might well feel aster the message sent him by Parmenio, although at
the same time he was trustsul (credebat) that it yet maintained its
ground. We see nothing in the text that necessarily implica that he
returned ‘⁴ spontaneouslyJ’ The want os methodin Curtius has been
