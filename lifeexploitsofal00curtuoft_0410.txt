Tales, Remarkable Facts, Amusing Anecdotes, δῖα, with a Diction-

[I. The Classis: French Reader 3

Or, Beauties of the French WriterS, Ancient and Modern. With a
Vocabulary of all the Words and Idioms contained in the Work.
By J. L. JEWETT. 12mo, 388 pageS.

The French readers of M. De Fivas possess features which distinguish them
strikingly, and, it is believed, favorabljg from all other series. The pieces presented
are short, lively, and spir-item not extracts of style and character that can be appre-
ciated only by a matttred and cultivated taste, but such as are likelyto ath-act the
young. Eaeh volume contains a caresully—constructed vocabula-y. The time generally
lost in searching through a large ffictionary, and the expenso of an additional book, are
thus saved.

The Elementary Reader, as its name imperta, is for beginncrs. It consists of short
and easy pieoes, written in familiar style, and os the most atti-active character.

The Classic Reader may, with advantage, follow the Elemenmm or may bo used
independently of it with somewhat older classes.
