own king, who, in this way, did not need foreigners to accomplish
his ruin''; that is, “was put to death by treacherous subjects.”
Such a construction seems harsh at first view, and yet it is in some
degree justified by the following clause, certe cui nos, ὥσ. Some
refer exterum opis to “the aid '' he needed, and obtained from Poly-
stratus, as mentioned in thc supplement to the fifth book.
