270 NOTES.

Noto

7. Superveniunt inde hyali—According to Arriani, these ambassadors
met the king at Gordium. Ι

8. Pari intervalla—Gur author’s gcographical statements are not
always to be depended on. His ideas with respect to the position
of the Sangarius and the width of Asia Minor, as expressed in this
and the following sentence, are very erroneous‚ as may bc seen by
consulting a good map.

9. Utroque, sc. mari.

10. &ammitteret—We give the reading herc as we find it; yet cannot
avoid thinking that the word should be committerentur. The eon-
struction, according to the received text, sounds harsh; for quoe,
referring to terram, is then the subject of committeret, and the

literal meaning of the passage would imply, that a pieee of land -

ean unite two seas. By making maria the subject of committerentur
the difficulty is avoided.

11. Notabile—We understand herc negotium, and translate: “The
remarkable thing about it (the chariot) was the yokc, which was
fastened‚” dxc.

12. Quippe, cta—The readings here vary very much; but the one in
the text, when read in the following order, seems to give the sense
of the author: Quippe [rex] affqressus solvere seriem vinculorum ita
adstrictam, ut posset percipi nec ratione nec visu unde nexus inciperet,
quave conderet se, injecerat curam [Macedonibus]‚ ne irritum incoeptwn
verteretur in omen.

15². Nequaquam—We agree with Freinsheim in prcserring this word
to nequicquam, as more characteristic of Alexander, who was not

, the one to tarry long at untying a knot, while his good sword was
at his side.

14 Tuta, se. loca„

15. Liberaturos, agreeing with Amphoterum and Hegelochum, and
governing Lesbum, &Q with proesidiis, as a verb of ‘⁸ depriving,’' ac-
cording to the grammar-s, though, in reality, proesidiis is govcrncd
by a preposition.

16. Talentm—The talent of silvcr was about SLOSG of our moncy;
the talcnt of gold, about sict-555. Our author, when using the
word without qualification, is supposed to refer to the talcnt os
silvcr. Sec Tables nt the end os Anthon's Classical Dictionary.

17. Proesidcrcnt.—“Might act as a pras-[dium or dcsencc.''

18. In apeme-An idiomatie phrase, rescrrfflg originally to the
“disentnnglemeut os the seet”; hence usi-codun] from obstacle&
“ readiness.”
