Note
14. (jam eo.—That is: Parmenio was impleaded with his surviving

son in the same charge.

15. Haud quaquam pro, &c.—“ In no way was the speech of Amyntas
as pleasing to the king, as he expected.'’

16. Parricidam.—-See Note 12, Lib. iu’. Cap. xii. ·

17. Ecquid videtis.—“ Do you not perceive? '’ Ecquid usually requires
a negative form of interrogation in English.

18. Odia-tenera—The reading adopted here by Zumpt as well as
by many before him, is adeo—toedere. We prefer the one given in
the text, because it is a form of expression similar to that used by
our author (Lib. iii. Cap. ii. ἓ 5, cir. med.)—beeause it is perfectly
correct in itself,—because taedere is too closely allied in signification
to fastidit in the next clause,——and *because adeo seems hardly re-
quired to give force to the sentence.

19. Ica.—“ With this remark.”

ΠΒ. VI. CAP. X.

1. Destitutu3.—Perhaps Curtius wrote distractus.

2. Proesertim calm quoerenti.—Philotas here refers to what is men-
tioned, Lib. vi. Cap. vii. ἓ 19, sub. fin. (Scisitari deiude, ⁴150) The
literal rendering of the passage is this: “Especially since to him
(Nicomachus), making inquiries as to who were accomplices‚ I must
have been named, though falsely, in order that he who was tamper-
ed with (“ was fearful '⁷ if we read verebatur) might be more readily
urged forward.''

3 Non enim, ὧσ.-“ For he did not omit my name after the crime
was discovered that he might seem to spare a friend, but in making
known the matter to Nicomachus, who, he believed, would be
silent as to secrets that coneerned himself, he mentioned others
and kept back my name alonc.'’ The text here, as well ns through·
ont this section, is very much disputed.

4. Dymnus εαηὲ, ὡσ.-“ Grant that Dymnus were both alive yet
and willing to sparo me; what will the rest [of the conspirators
d0]? Will they, forsooth, wno confess their own guilt keep back
my name? ’' The argument οἰ Philotas is this: Even if Dymnus
were alive and willing to sparo me, the other conspirators, if I were
guilty, would not5 but as thoy do not inform against mc, it is a fair
proof of my innocence.

5. Unum—‘⁴ Tho only oncf'

6. Dimissus—‘¹Discl1m·god.”
