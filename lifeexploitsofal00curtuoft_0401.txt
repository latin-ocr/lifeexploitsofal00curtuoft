to Greek Construing, and a Treatlse on the Greek Particles3 also, copious selsa-
tions from Greek Authors‚ with Critiml and Explanatory English Notes, and a
Lexicon. 12mo, 618 peges.

A complete, thorough, practical nnd easy Greek course is here presented. The
eeginner commences with the “First Book‚'' in which the elementary principles a(
the langunge are nnsolded, not in abstract language, difficnlt both to comprehend and
to remember‚ but as practically applied in sentences. Throughout the whole, the
pupil sees Just where he stands, and is taught to use and apply what he learns. Hie
progr-ess is, therefore, as rapid as itis intelligent and pleasant. There is no unnecea·
sary verbiage, nor is the pupil's attention diverted irem what is really important by
a mass ot minor details. It is the experience or teachers who use this book, that with
*i- a given amount os Greek Grammar can be imparted to a pupil in a shorter time and
with m· less trouble than with any other text-book.

The “First Book” may with advantage be followed by the ‘⁴ Introduction to
Greek Prose composition.” The object os this work is to enable the student, us acon
aa he can decline and conjugate with tolerable facility‚ to translate simple sentences
aiter given examples and with given words3 the principles employed being those or
imitation and very nequent repetition. It is at once a Synna, a Vombulary, and an
axel-eise book. The ‘⁴ Second Part” carries the saneet further, unsolding the most
complicated constructions, and the nicest points of Latin Syntax. Δ Key is provided
ht the teacher's nse.

'l'he ‘⁴ Bessan-,⁹⁸ besides extr-acts judicionsly selected trem the Greek classice, contains
nlnable insu-actions to gulde the learner in translating and construing, and a completa
exposition of the pfflcles, their signification and government. It is a fitting sequel to
the eoeiier parisos the course„ everywhere showing the hand oi an acute ‹tx-itio, aa
accampusbad scholar, and an expet-lenced teacher.
