10. Inlaibentes ‘remia—This phrase expresses what is called in nauti-

cal language “backing water.’' Livy (xxvi. 39) has Neque retro
navem inhiberent, omitting remis. The following also occurs in
Lucan’s Pharsalia (iii. 659):

Postquam inhibent remia puppes, ac rostra recedunt.

ll. Evelle're—This verb is in the third plur. perf. ind. aet„ not the
pres. inf. act. We have the authority of Cicero sor the use of evelli
instead os evulsi.

12. Submoveretur.—“ Was kept at a distaneel’

13. Inqenti animo, periculo majora—‘⁴ With great eourage, with still
greater risk.” Aeidalius thinks that Alexander himself would have
preferred, that the adjectives should have exchanged places.

14. Reyio ineiqni.—“ The royal diadem.”

15. Crebris arietibus—‘⁴ By frequent strokes of the battering ram.”
Arrian, who describes this whole scene more in detail, states that
Alexander gave orders that the ships of the fleet, fitted out with
moveable bridges, should attack the whole circuit of the walls,
‘⁴ that the Tyrians pressed on all sides might be thrown into eon-
fusion. Thiswas done, and the ship that bore the king having
reached a part of the wall, breaclaed by the battering ram, the bridgo
was thrown across the space between the ship and the wall. Ad-
metus, a distinguished warrior, was the first to mount the breach,
but was slain by a lance. Alexander himself, with a few attendants,
immediately sueceeded, and was the first to take possession os any
part of the wall.’' (Lib. ii. aab. fin. p. 146, Blaneard's ed. 1668.)
For an interesting account of ‘¹ moveable bridges ’' for ships of war,
see Arnold’s History of Rome. (Vol. Π. p. 156. Ncw York, 1846

16. Occupant, ‹fia—That is: They anticipato death, while it was in
their power to choose the mode.

rm Nemo tamen armatus, ‹sm—“No one, however, with arms in his
hands, could bear to seek aid from the Gods'’; that is, by taking
refuge in their temples. -

18. &mentibu—“The insuriated soldiers.'’

19. Intra Macedonum praesidia—Intra proeeidt'a seems here equivalcnt
to Cicero's in proesidiis; that is, “with the armyss’ “belonging to
the eamp.’‘ See Orat. pro Lig. v. 69, and Epist. ad Fam. 13, 19.
Scheffer however remarks, Suspicor locum non esse eatis inteqrum.

20. In quibua occidendi, ‹ie—“In whose case,” or “With regard to
whom the tage os kining had eeased,’‘ through exhaustion on the
