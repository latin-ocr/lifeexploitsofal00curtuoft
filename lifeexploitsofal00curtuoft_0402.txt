By ALBERT HARKNESS, Aut, Senior 111115101- in the Provide-noe
High School. 121110, 362 pages. -

Thls work is designed as a sequel to the author's ‘⁴ First Latin Book.” It comprisos
ι complete analytica] syntax, exhibiting the essential structure of the Latin language,
bom its simplest to its most expanded and elaborate form.

The arrangement or the lessons is decidedly philosophical, gradually progressive,
and in stu-iet accordance with the law of development of the human mind. Every new
principle is stated in simple, clear, and accurate language, and illustrated by examples
carefully selected from the reading Iessons‚ which the student is required to translate,
analyze, and reconsoeuct. He is also εχει-015011 in forming new Latin sentences on
given models. This, while'it gives variety and interest to what would otherwise be
111 1110 highest degree monotonous, completely fixes in the mind the subJect οἵ the
less0n‚ both by analysis and synthesis.

The careful study of this volume, on the plan recommended by the author, will
greatly facilitate the pupil's progr-ess in the higher departments os the ianguage. Such
is the testimony of the numerous institutione iu which Harkness's improved edition
of Arnold has been introduced

the late lamented Arnold. based his educational works; and in the Selections sor
