With English Notes, Critieal and Explanator53 a Lexieon, Geograpni·
eal and Historieal indues, a Map of Gaul, 320. By Rev, J. A.
SPENCER, D.D 12mo, 408 pages.

ln un preparation of this volume, great care has been taken to adapt itin every
respect to the wants of the young student, to make it a means et the same time οἱ
edvancing him in a·thorough knowledge of Latin, and inspiring him with a desire for
further acquaintance with the elassies of the language. Dr. Speneer has not, like ’
some commentators‚ given au abundanee of help on the easy passages, and allowed the
difficult ones to speak for themselves. His Notes are on those parts on which the
pupil wants them, and explain, not only grammatieal difficulties, but allusione of every
kind in the text. A well-drawn sketeh oi' Caesar's life, a Map of the region in which
his campaigns were carried ou, aud a Vocabulury, which removes the necessity of using
ο, large dictionary and the waste of time consequent thereon, enhauee the valae of mo
volume in no small degree.

Quintus Curtius :

Δ Life and Exploits of Alexander the Great. Editcd and illustrated with
English Notos. By WM. HENRY CROSBY. 12mo, 385 pages.

Curtius· History of Alexander the Great‚ though little used in the sehools of this
country, in EngIand and on the Continent holds a high place in the estimation of
classical instructore. The interesting character of its subJeet‚ the eleganee of its style
and the purity of its moral sentiments, ought to place it nt least on a par with Caesar’·
Commentaries or Sallust's Histories. The present edition, by the late Professor οι
Latin in Rutgers ColIege, is unexceptionable in typography, convenient in form.
scholari y and praetical in its notes, and altogether an admirable text-book for classe·
preparing for college.
