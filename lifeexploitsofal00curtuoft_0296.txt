-286 NOTES.

ἔξω Suo more—Thai: is: by prostration. ⁷ See Note '7 of this chapter.

16. Monstrantibus.—Supply quibusdam.

17. Nam et hic, csta—Thac is: ‘⁶ He is my other self,”—implying the
intimacy that subsisted between them. Alexander used to say of
him, that he loved Alexander, but that Craterus loved the kiny.

18. Equidem, si, ‹fia—Every render will concur in the sentiment here
expressed, aud will feel the force of our author's remarks the fur-
ther he proceeds in this interesting biography.

19. Indictei causa.—“Without a hearing.’'

20- Superfuderat, ‹ita—“Had not overflowed his mind ”3 “uad not
drowned'' his better feelings.

21. Ad ultimum, ‹ea—“At last he was incapable of enduring its
greatness.'’ That is : He could not withstand the temptatione
thrown in his way by constant success.

22. Adeo ipse—ut.—“ He not only did not himself—but”.

23. Nequi-3, ‹ssa—“That no one should trifie with the persons of any
of his captives.'' Zumpt has the following singular note, which is
certainly abhorrent to the context: “Slzould insult ; namely, by
proposals to them to become traitors to Darius.”

24. AEquitate—Raderus succinctly eontrasts the conduct of Alexander
with that of Darius, in the following note. “Barim Maccdonas
crudeliter vel mactavit, vel mutilavit, et hoe ante proelium Alexander
totum ipsius yynoeceum sacrosanctum servavit. Darius percussorem
mille talentis in Alexandrum immittere conabatur, ciam oeyer Tarsi
decumberet ,· Ῐιοσ nunquam feeit Alexander, qui apertd semper virtute
et Marte gyras-<sabatur ad yloriam. Proeterea, ut ex epia-told Alexandri
ad ,Darium infra disces, parens Alexandri, Persarum impulsu, ut ipsi
yloriabantur, interfectus est,’' ‹iz-c. Sisygambis had certainly good
reason to draw a comptu-ison between Alexander and her own son
iu favour of the former.

25. Et prcetera'toe, ‹ea-⁸⁴1 nm not carried away by the clevation of
my former state, and nm able to bear the yoke os present advemit5.”
Capio is used in the same sense us capit ubovo; see Note 21. Pati
jngsum, “to bear the yoke,” is a figure os speech obviously taken
from the patient endumnce of the ox while under the yoke, and is
frequently employed in Scripturc. The most apposite instance
occurs in Lunicntutions iii. 27. “It is good sor a man to bear the
yoke in his youth.'’

26. Tuci interna—Zumpt considers tnui iu the nblntive; his translu-
tor, Schmitz, however, considers it nn accusative sor tuam. See
Hnrkncss' Latin Grummar, 5408, 1, 2). The passage mny be ren-
