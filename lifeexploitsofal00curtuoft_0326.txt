Note

12. Emissa aculeo, ‹ea—This refers to what is stated by naturalists,
that the bee, aster having dai-ted forth her sting, perishes, or as
some say, becomes torpid. Livy (xxiii. 42) represents the ambas-
sadors of the Hirpini and Samnites as using the same metaphor
when addressing Hannibal. “

13. Hinc Euphrates, cha—This is one out of many of oui· author's
geographical inconsisteneies. He forgets that Arbela was eastward
of the Tigris as well as the Euphrates·

14. Animal.—“A living creature? “a mortal being.'’ The termis
peculiar and striking, and cannot fail to eall to mind the epithets
given in Scripture to this same conqueror. See Daniel (vii. 6 and
viii. 5.)

15. Cui non subest ralia—“Which is not founded on reason?

16. Tamen ad ultimum, ὧε.-“ Stin, in the long run, it fails to sustain
rashness.'’

17. Simpliciter.—Tha1: is: without some sinister design. Horace
(Cal-m. i. 34) thus alludes to the fiekle character of Fortune:

·-- Ηίηο apicem rapam
Fortuna cum stridore acuto
Sustulit, hie posuisse aaudet.

18. M0d0.—“Lately.” He refers to the invasione of Greece by Da-
rius Hystaspis and Xerxes.

19. Nisi quod, ‹ha—“With the exception of what 1 possess in you,
I myself, as regards the· greater part of me, am a captive.’'

20. ’ Viscera mem—‘¹ My howels.” The ancients supposed this part
of the body to be the scat of the tender emotions, and hence by a
figurative use of the term it was made to denote the objects of those
emotions.

21 Precario victu.—“ A life dependent on the favour of another?

2⁰.. Per, eqo vos, Deos, dha—Some read here Precor vos per Deos,
but this is more elegant. Oro, however, must be understood to
govern vos. We find similar phraseology in Lib. v. ἓ 24, ειιὸ fin„
and Lib. ix. ἓ 6, sub fin.

LIB. IV. CAP. XV.

1. Aymen obliquum, ‹fa—That is, according to modern military
phrase: “ He orders tho attacking column to move cn ‹⁵chellon” to
the right, for the purposcs mentioned.

2 Saum, sc. aymcn.
