Ollendorff's French Grammars have been before the public so long, and
uve had their men'ts so generally acknowledged, that it is unnecessary ω
mter into any detailed description os their peculiarities or lengthy argument
in their favor. Suffice it to say, that they are founded in nature, and follow
the same comse that a child pursuoe in first acquir-ing his native tongue.
They teach induetively, understandingly, interestingly. They do not repel
the student in the outset by obliging him to memor-ize dry abstract language
which conveys little or no idea to his mind, but impart their Iessons agree
nbly as well as efficiently by exercisae, which teach the principlae success
ively involved more clearly than any abso-aet language can. They give a
conver-sational, and therefore a pmctically useful, knowledge of the language;
the student is made constantly to apply what he learns. 'ro these peculi
ttities is due the wide-spread and lasting popularity os the Ollendorff series.

Prot Greene's Introduction, the first of the works named above, will be
round useful for young beginners. In it are presented the fundamental
principloe of the language, caresully culled ont», and illustrated with easy
noedses. It pavae the way sor the larger works, preparing the pupil'e
mind for their more comprehensive course and awakening in it a desire sm
&ther knowledge.

Value's and Jewett‘s wax-ks are essentially the same, though differ-ing

omewhat in their arrangement and the additions that have been made to
tho on'ginal. Some institutione prefer one, and others the other; either, it
{a believed, will impart a thorough aoquaintnnoe with Freneh, beth grum
mtioel and conversatioual, by an interesting process, and with but litu:
