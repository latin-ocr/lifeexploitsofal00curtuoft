NOTES. 319

Nou
Greek idiom called attraction) for iic quos, iis being governed by

· inferiorem. Instances of this nature are certainly not altogether
wanting in Latin authors.

7. Speciosa dictu—“Striking in their announcement ”; usu necea-
saria, ‘⁸ practically useful.”

8. Omnia aequi armatos.—“That all things follow in the train of
those well armed.”

9. Euntibus α parte loevd, ‹isa—This is loeus vexatissimus, aud critics
have exhausted all their acumen upon it to no purpose. It stili
remains as unsatisfactory and inexplicable as ever. We have given
the reading and punctuation adopted by Zumpt, and we subjoin
his note on the passage. ⁸‘ Arabia is here that part of the country
between the Euphrates and Tigris, which was occupied by the
Arabians. If this district was on the left of the Macedonians,
Alexander must have recrossed the Tigris near Arbela, and marched
through the middle of Mesopotamiw It is hardly probable that
Alexander, in marching from Arbela to Babylon, though he should
cross the Tigris, would go so far westward as to leave that part of
Mesopotamia, inhabited by the Arabians, on his &fl hand, when
his nearest way would bc almdst due south, inclining very little to
the west. (See Butler’s Ancient Atlas.) sse fact is, probably,
that Curtius, as in other instances, is alittle out in his geography,
on which subject he does not appear “ to know his right hand from
his left!

10. Campestre icen—“A level route.”

11. Ιαιεηίἰα, sc. loca.

12. Magno deinde, ‹im—‘⁸ And then after a wide separation of their
streams.”

13. Qui amplissimum, cta—“Those who have notcd the greatest in-
terval [between them] have made the distance? (bc.

14. Media—Another instance of our author’s inaccuracy. Media
was sar to the east of both rivers. Gordianorum—This word ap-
pears in a great variety of forms in different editions, but the true
reading. even if ascertainable, would be of small consequence.

15. Arctim, sc. epatium.

16. Quo-luza—Both these words may be translated by the article
‘¹ the.'’ “ The sarther they flow,” dxc.

17. Iidem—Freinsheim conjectures tandem, which would be moro
natural and sorcible than the present reading.

18. Inyentis operia—See Note 4, Lib. iv. Cap. vi.

19. Manu promptus.—⁴‘B01d—vigor0ns in action.''
