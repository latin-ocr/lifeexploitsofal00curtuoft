German and English, and English and Ger

man Pronouncing Dictionary.

By G. J. ADLER, A.M., Professor of the German Language and
Literature in the University of N ew York. One elegant large evo
vol„ 1‚4oo pages.

The mm of the distinguished author of this work has been tro
embody all the valuable results of the most recent investigations ir.
a German Lexicon, which might become not only a reliable guido
for the practical acquisition of the language, but one which woud
not forsake the student in the higher walks of his pursuits, to which
its treasures would invite him.

In the preparation of the German and English Part, the basis
adopted has been the work of Fluge1‚ compiled in reality by Hei-
mann, Feiling, and Oxenford. This was the most complete and
Judiciously prepared manual of the kind in England.

Τ110 present work contains the accentuation of every German
word, several hundred synonymes, together with a classification
and alphabetical list of the irregular verbs, and a Dictionary of
German abbreviations.

The foreign words, likewise, which have not been completely
Germanized‚ and which often differ in pronunciation and inflectiou
from such as are purely native, have been designated by'particular
marks.

Tho vocabulary of foreign words, which now act so lmportant
a part, not only in scientific works, but in the best classice, reviews,
Journals‚ newspapers, and even in conversation, has been copiously
supplied from the most complete and correct sourceS. It is believed
that in the terminology of chemistry, minerfflogy, the practical arts,
commerce, navigation, rhetoric, grammar, mythology, philosophy,
ἄτα, scarcely a word will be found wanting.

The Second or German-English Part of this volume has been
chiefly reprinted from the work of Flagel. (Τ110 attention which
hm been paid 111 Germany to the preparation of English dictionario-2⁴
for the German student has been such as to render these workr
very complete. Τ110 student, therefore, will scarcely find any thino
deficient in this Second Part.)
