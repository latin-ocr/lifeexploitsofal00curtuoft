noras. 303

Note

10. Haud sectae qudm, &c.—“ Tbey looked in vain for the land [turn-
ing] their eyes in every direction, like those who have entered
upon the boundless deep.” By terram is meant something of a
firmer character than the loose and moving sand through which
they were passing.

11. Utribus cameli.—Skins filled with water are still carried on the

'baeks of camels across that desert, as they were 2000 years ago.

12. Ob sitim impotentes wi.-=—“Having no control over themselves
on account of their thirst.'’

13. Antecedentium,‘d·c.—“Aster the manner of those who go before
and. point out the way.”

14. Vix, the student will observe‚ refers to cadente, not to contecta est.

15. Coeluz—“ Of climate.”

16. Accoloe sedis, ‹ka—The geography of Curtius, as has been demon-
strated by many critica is very much at fault in this description of
the boundaries of the settlement around the temple of Hammon.

17. Navigiorum spoliis, ‹fia—“Who enrich themselves on the spoils
οἱ [shipwrecked] vessels.”

18. Et oenu, ὧσ.-“ And seize in shallows well known to themselves
*vessels that have been lest by the tide.'’

19. Tyrannorum—-This word is here used in its earliest sense of an
absolute monareh, without reference to the manner in which he
exereised his authority.

20. officulam—This word, like the English “ oracle,'’ has a twosold
signification, via, the place where a response is given, and tlae re-
sponse itself.

21. Inclinato, sc. die.

22 Donec cub ipsum, ‹ta—“Until about day-light it moderates to its

⁷ usual‘lukewarm temperature.”

23. Umbilico maxime, ‹fia—This passage has given rise to much dis-
eussion among eommentators, and various readings have been sug-
gested. We have retained that which appears to be least open to
objection. Habitus here means “the outward form’' or “appear-
anee‚”—a sense in which the word is used several times by our
author. (See Note l, Lib. vi. Cap. xi.) As to the visible represen-
tation of the deities os the ancients. by “smooth stones,’' or by a
union of gems iu the form here indicated, we would refer the in-
quiring student not only to Freinsheim’s note on this passage, but
also to Kitto's Daz‘ly Bible Illum-atium (Isaiah and the Prophets,
19th περὶ, Wednesday)‚ aad to a learned disquisition on the sub-
ject in Godsrey Iliggins's Celtic Druias, (Lohdon, 1829, p. 209.)
