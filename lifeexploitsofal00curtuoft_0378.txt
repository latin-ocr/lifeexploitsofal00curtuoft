Rerum adesse, ‹ra—“That a deeisive action was at hand.”

Omissis habenis.—“Letting sall the reins.’' Effusis habenis.—
“ With loosened reins,'’ that is: At full speed.

Movebantur‚ se. Elephanti.

Hemonam—The subject of this verb is deseruisse metantes.

Ex illo hoste—“From him when an enemy.”

Dextrum move.—“Th1·ow the right wing of the enemy into con-
fusion.'’' Crities agree that there is an error here, but how to solve

Non alitia—“In no other way.’'

kin them, but even to inflict in death some additional pain.” The
learned commentator then na'ivcly subjoins the following observa-
tion: “ leat the soldiers had any intention to inflict unnccessary pain
upon the animal-3 wc cannot sor α moment believe ‚· the statement is a
mere rhetorical exaqfferatiort.’' Others, however (and with them we
coincide in opinion). prefer connecting the genitivos with timor, and
give this sense to the passage: ‘⁸ The sear. not. only os death, but of
new tortures in death, lest nothing untried‚‘' by which the attacks
os the elephante might be repelled. Tho idea thus suggested follows
very naturally aster the mention ot' sapidas in the preceding sen—
