morus. 329

Note

10. Temporis qratia—“ To meet the present exigency.”

11. Justo re9L—“ The rightful sovereign.”

12. Fidueiarium—“ Which he had held in trust.”

13. Quanquam tam, ‹ee—“Although the sun extent of crime conceal-
ed under such an impious speech was unknown to him.’' 'Ibe
student will note the force of subin subesset.

14. Pessimum—mancipium—“ Thou vilest of slaves.”

15. N i proper& Bessus, ‹te—“Unless with all speed Bessus and the
Bactrians, under pretence of being indignant [at the conduct of
N abarzanes], bnt [in reality] intending if he (Darius) persevered in
his purpose, to bind him, had interposed.” Lit. “ Had stood round.”
Tristis is used in the sense of “ angry '’ by virgil (AEneid. 1. 612) and
Propertius (i. 6, 10.)

16. Temporum, dte—‘¹ Occasionally remiuding him of existing circum-
stances.’'

17. G-ravem etiam si, ‹te.—“ A formidable enemy even ir all his
(Darius’) friends should be at hand to help him.”

18. ὥρη-ἐ* Reluctantly.”

19 Patrm—Arrian calls him Paron. He seems to have been a man
of fine character.

20. Ut cibum, cha—“That he would partake of sood, and assume the
spirit expected of a king.'’ We prefer the reading given in the text
as consonant with a similar use of the word capio (Lib. iv. Cap. i.
§4) Cape reyis animum. See also Note 12, Lib. iv. Cap. xii. The
other readings are: Animumque regis adverteret and averteret. Ani-
mumque euris reyni adverteret. Animumque rebus adverteret. This
last is adopted by Zumpt.

LIB. V. CAP. IX.

1. Eximia—“Highly esteemed.”

2. Regionis—Zumpt reads reyis here ; but as the arguments sor the
present reading are very strong we have concluded to retain it..

3. Οεσίωή-ρειίειιτὶ-Ψε should certainly expect to find these
words in the dative aster placuit. As they stand we may supply
essent with them.

4. Consternatt'onent—“Their mutinous conduct.” The word is used
in this sense by Tacitus and Livy, ns well as repeatedly by our
author. See Lib. vii. Cap. ii. 57, Lib. viii. Cap. i. §a (where it ἰι
used synonymously with seditio), and Lib. x. Cap. ii. §⁷-

5. Solieitarent.—“To tamper with.”
