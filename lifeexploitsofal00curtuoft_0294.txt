284 NOTES.

Nouggroundl' We have ventured to alter the position of the word

dilapsi, as more accordant to the sense. The common reading places
it after equis, which would have been well enough, had the word
been relapsi. .

17. serie laminarum yraves.—-“ Encumbered with plato armour.'' It
was no uncommon thing in ancient, as well as more modern times,
for horses and riders to be clad in complete armour. See Anthon's
Smith’s Antiquities.

18. ,Aymen quod celeritate, dha—‘⁴ With difficulty formed into column,
a movement which depende upon celerity for its value.’' We would
make quod refer to the whole statement and not to the single word
aymen. This whole passage has been much vexed by critica, and
after all their labours it is by no means free from difficulties.

19. Haud sane, «ἕω-’111111 is: Tbey were not ronted but made an
orderly retreat.

20. Nec ulla facies, <ea—“Nor was any form of misery wanting.”
The picture here displayed has been too faithfully copied by nations
calling themselves christinus, as Drogheda, Badajoz‚ Saragossa, aba,
sadly testify.

21. Tunc vero, ‹fia—“Then truly might be seen un instance of in-
tolerable missortune.’' For the successive shades of meaning in the
word impotens, see Leverett's Lexicon.

22. Fomnae pulchritudine.—“ By the beauty of her person.”

23. Laceratis, ὠο.-“ With their hair dishevelled and their garmcnts
rent:’'—the well-known marks of profound grief among Oriental
nations.

24. Veris quondam, ‹fic.—“ Titles that once were applicable but now
no longer belonged to them.''

25. Caesa sunt, cbo—The numbers herc mentioned as slain are ltu-ge,
but seem small in comptu-ison with the numbers that fell in the
battle, between Abijah, King of J ndah and Jeroboam, King of Israe-
Sce O. T. (Π. Chron. xiii. 17.)

LIB. III. CAP. XII.

1. Spen non eran-Non may. in many casos, bc adjectively tmus-
lntod by the word ‘¹ n0,” ns iu the present instance. ‘·‘ There was no
hopc.”

2. Cultn.—“ Drcss.” Tho ordor is, Namque un 11.oe e carptis spadonibus,
quifortc stateras ante ipsarum tahsrnaenlmn. agrum-it amiculum, (quod
Darius, sicut (lictum cst paulo «nm, aly‘cccrat, ne proderetur cultu.) iu
