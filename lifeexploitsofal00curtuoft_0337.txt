Note

2. Indicantoe.—“1ntimating.”

8. &pediam—“hee from obstaclesss’ Freinsheim considers this
inconsistent with what our author mentions in the next sentence,
namely, that the Araxes (a broad stream, and which could only be
croesed by beate or bridges) was to be passed, and accordingly pro-
posoe to read qudm qud instead of quamquam. We think the change
unnecessary, the latter word being here employed, as it osten is,
to modify the soregoing statement. It may be rendered, “ Though,
to be ειη-εἶ’

4. Inter pauca—Equivalent to in paucis, elsewhere used. See Not»
11, Lib. iii. Cap. xi.

5. [retamim—native aster liquere, and itself governing poenaa

6. Similea—-dawarea—“ Alike in severity—different in eircum-
stanees?

’1. omnes, sc. eircumtantee—1‘ All the by-standers.”

8. Noa—We retain this pronoun as used emphatically. Some copies
read Ηῖ, others Ιῑ.

9. Familian‘a—“ Friendly.”

10. Quem celeriter, ‹ke—This is (to use the words of Theaetetus a

(Nemofideliter,dx.)totheir ovnaad case seems to requireits
presence.

12. Grati pronus, ‹hc—Said ironieally.

13. Barim—“Serapinga’

14. Quota pan nomi—⁴⁴ How mall a part of ns?

15. Pium—This word and ita derivativa are probably applied by
Latin writers more frequently to the sentimenta entertained towards
men than ω those towards the gods. Theyare used to designate tho
affection existing between relatives and friends when carried to a
seli-denying extent. Hence AEneaa seems to have aoquired the
epithet οἶμαι, in Virgil, tor saving the lise οἱ his aged father at the
riak of his own.

16. Vua-morte—Abhfivae of price.

17. Quin appear-eto be here used elliptically. The ellipsis may be
thus supplied, Quid obstat quin, dx.

18. Inposita-“Their birthright'·

19. Relinquennt—“ ney certainly might leave [this place. their
Persian attachmente] to whom nothing,” ἁο. Digby givoe a dif-
