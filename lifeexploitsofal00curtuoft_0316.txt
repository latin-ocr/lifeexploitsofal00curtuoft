LIB. IV. CAP. IX.

1. subsisterem—‘⁶ Should make a stand)

2. Haud dabie, ‹fia—‘⁴ As one who would doubtless exert a very
powerful influenee in person in exeiting to an active part in the
war those distant tribes, which he with difficulty roused to aetion by
means of his satrape.'’

rity.''

sary he had to deal.'' Supply siba· aster esset.

with Darius.

7. Domandi.—“ That were to be broken in.''

8. Quadriyae.—The student will bear in mind that the ancients har-
nessed their horses abi-east of each other, irrespeetive of the num-

when all other writers represent Arbela as a distinguished city (see
particularly Strabo, Lib. xvi), wrote Gaugamela, and that Arbela
has been soisted into the text by some transcriber, who had only
heard os the action as having taken place near that city.
