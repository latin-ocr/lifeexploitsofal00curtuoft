316 NOTES.

ἔξω Laevoque‚ ‹ea—“And, upon the rout of the lest wing‚ had deserted

the chariot, which the crowded ranks on the right immediately re·
eeived into their division.’'

25. Sed eminens, ‹fia—The order is: Sed eminens curru erubeseebat
destituere aciem suorum nondum omnem excedentem prcelio.

26. Haerebat in teryz's, ὢσ.-“ Hung upon the rear of the fugitives.”

27. Subinde coeuntes.—“ Once in a while uniting their forces!

LIB. IV. CAP. XVI.

1. Lonye alid, ‹fia—‘⁴ With far different results on both sides.”

2. Jamque abundans, ὡσ.-“ And now with overwhelming numbers
he had begun to surround that division?

3. Refraenare equos jussit, ὠσ.-“ He ordered those who were
mounted (lit. ‘⁴ were carried '') to draw bridle upon their horses (i. e„
“to eheck the pursuit ’⁵), and halted the column of infantry.”
Zumpt's rendering of this passage (in which he reads jussi) is, ‘¹ The
horsemen were ordered to take off the bits, that they might give the
horses a breath‚ and then ride off briskly in an opposite direction.”
He certainly seems to have mistaken the sense of refraenare. We
give constitit a transitive force which we find it having in a similar
passage in Sallust (J ugur. 49). Besides as sisto is frequently used in
a transitive sense, it is probable that its eompound consisto was used
in the same way.

4. Beudena, ‹te—‘⁴ Gnashing his tecth with vexation that victory
should be snatehed‚’' dte.

5. Nobis quoque—‘⁴ In our behalf too.’‘ This is called by some gram·
marians the dative of reference.

6. Omnia PersarunL—Every thing—homes, ehariots, standards‚ aa
well as men.

7. Receclebat.—“ Gave παῖζ’ with their faces towards the enemy.

8. Spatio.—“ A respite.’'

9. Malle se, ‹ie—This is one among many instances of the magnani-
mous disposition of “ Darius great and good?

10. Ingens spatium—This shows that the battle was fought nt· n
great distance from Arbela. Some suppose it to have been sixty
miles, and the fact that Darius did not arx-ive there in his hasty
ssight till midnight justifies the supposition.

11. findebantur extemplo, ‹hx—‘⁴ Their bowcls were nt once distended
by the pressure of the clay?

Ι2. L'c snpra ‹lictum—See above, Noto 3
