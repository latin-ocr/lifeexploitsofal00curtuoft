ΒΥ G. J. ADLER, Professor of the German Language and Literature in
the University of the City of N ew York. 12mo, 308 page-⁴³.

 

 

'rie plan of this German Reader is as follows:

1. The pieees are both prose and poetry, selected from the best authors,
11εά present sufficient variety to keep alive the interest of the scholar.

2. It is progressive in its nature, the pieces being at first very short and
may, and increasing in difficulty and length as the learner advances.

3. At the bottom of the page constant references to the Grammar aro
made, the difficult passages are explained and rendered. To encourage the
first attempt of the learner as much as possible, the twenty-one pieces of
the first section are analyzed, and all the necessary words given at the bot
tom of the page. The notes, which at first are very abundant, diminish as
the learner advanceS.

4. It contains five sections. The first contains easy piecos, chiefly in
prose, with all the words necessary for translating them3 the second, short
pieces in prose and poetry alternately, with eopious notes and renderings·
the third, short popular tales of Grimm and others3 the fourth, select bal-
19115 and other poems from BUrger, Goethe, Schssler, Uhland, Schwab, Cha-
rnisse, &e ; the fifth, prose extraets from the first classieS.

5. At the end is added a vocabulary of all the words oecurring in the

nook.

The pieees have been selected and the notes prepared with great tastc
and judgment, so much so as to render the book a general savoiite with

German toachers.
