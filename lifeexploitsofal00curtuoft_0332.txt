Note

20. Mayi.—See Note 12, Lib. iii. Cap. iii.

21. Ad luxuriam, ‹ta—“More fitted sor luxui-icus indulgenze than
mere display.''

22. Cum curru.-In this expression Curtius undoubtedly has refer-
ence to the triumphal entry into Rome of a victorious general. ·
23. Ipsius urbis pulchitudo, dea-The vastness, beauty, and antiquity
of Babylon have long been the theme of admirati0n; historians
and other writers have vied with each other in expatiating on its
wonders. 'For interesting particulare, with regard to this famous
city, called in Scripture(1saiah xiii. 19) ‘⁴ The ylory of kinydoms‚’‘
“lee beauty of the Chaldees' exeellency‚’' we refer the student to
Calmet’s Dictionary, (Charlestown, 1817, V. 226.) and Prideaux³s

Connexion (Harper's ed. I. 119.)

24. Laterculo coctili.—“ With small bricks burnt οι· baked in the fire.”
The Vulgate (Gen. xi. 3.)‚ where the first step toward the founding
of Babylon is described, has Faciamus lateres et coquamus eos iqui.

25. emmam—“To pass each othc1·.’' Con here gives a reciproeal
force to the simple verb.

26. Centum cubitorum—*Some editions read L., but as Herodotus
goes as high as two hundred, we think the present reading most
likely to be the true one.

27. CCCLXV stadia.—Equivalent to about 42 of our miles. See
table of weights and mensures at the end of Anthon's Clas. Diet.

28. Sinyalorum stadiorum, cta—This statement will appear almost
incredible when we consider, that, if the walls were only one hun—
dred cubits high (Herodotus makes them two hundred royal cubits,
which he says are three digits longer than the common ones), there
would have been at least 3055233 yards of solid masonry consu-noted
each day. Diodorus (Lib. ii.) states what is more probable, that
Semiramis assigned each stadium to a particular individual, surnish·
ing him at the same time with the means, and requiring the whole
work to be donc within a year.

29. Jufleris.—This is usually a superficial measure, bnt here it an-
swers to the Greek word πλεθρον, and indicates mere length. As
s ich it is reekoned nt 104 feet..

30. Continuoe.—“Contiguous.''

31. Crepidinibus.—“ By sides os heavy mnsonry ”

32. Omnium operum maynitmlincm.——Equivalent to Omnia mayn«
